### shopifychallenge

My submission for the Shopify Frontend Internship challenge.

## A chat room to converse with OpenAI's GPT-3 AI bots.

## Tech Used: Javascript, Firebase

For this project, I focused on making a simple UI and smooth UX by adding alerts to let the user know when an input is missing from the form submission, removing the text after submission to make it easier to the next submission, and by separating the user's prompt from the API's response in the "chat history" to make it easier to follow.

I also added the following functionalities:
- The use of local storage so that when user refreshes their page, they can still see the previous history, as well as clearing that history should they wish to.
- The ability to choose a different engine to send their prompt to, which is reflected in the "chat history".

## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I would make a separate chat history for each of the different bots. I would also provide a "hover-over" explanation at what each of the bots is good at for the engine selection. I would also improve upon the mobile-friendliness of the website as the chat history text boxes are too small at the moment.

## Lessons Learned

I learned that there are always multiple ways to approach a given problem, and if the first one you think of sounds too complicated, you should probably keep thinking.
